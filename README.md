This is an application where we gauge your performance on the physical fitness test called the Cooper Test (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooper_test).

We use Ruby on Rails for the backend functionality and use JavaScript to create the logic on the client side. The application is a mobile only application for iOS and Android and we use AngularJS and Ionic to connect the backend to the client side logic.
